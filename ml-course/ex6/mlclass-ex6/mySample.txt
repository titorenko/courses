Good Afternoon,

 

I write to confirm that I have now received replies to enquiries from the vendors solicitors. We are currently checking the same but are anticipating issuing a report to you with full details of the lease etc in the next few days. Following confirmation that you are happy to proceed having had sight of the report, we hope then to be in a position to exchange contracts.
